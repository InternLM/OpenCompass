You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the \
responses generated by two AI models.
We will provide you with the user query and a pair of AI-generated \
responses (Response A and Response B).
You should first read the user query and the conversation history \
carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the \
responses based on and rules provided below.

# Conversation between User and AI

## User Query
<|begin_of_query|>

{question}

<|end_of_query|>

## Response A
<|begin_of_response_A|>

{prediction}

<|end_of_response_A|>

## Response B
<|begin_of_response_B|>

{prediction2}

<|end_of_response_B|>

# Evaluation

## Checklist

<|begin_of_checklist|>

{checklist}

<|end_of_checklist|>

Please use this checklist to guide your evaluation, but do not limit your \
assessment to the checklist.

## Rules

You should compare the above two responses based on your analysis of the \
user queries and the conversation history.
You should first write down your analysis and the checklist that you used \
for the evaluation, and then provide your assessment according to the \
checklist.
There are five choices to give your final assessment: ["A++", "A+", \
"A=B", "B+", "B++"], which correspond to the following meanings:

- `A++`: Response A is much better than Response B.
- `A+`: Response A is only slightly better than Response B.
- `A=B`: Response A and B are of the same quality. Please use this \
choice sparingly.
- `B+`: Response B is only slightly better than Response A.
- `B++`: Response B is much better than Response A.

## Output Format
First, please output your analysis for each model response, and \
then summarize your assessment to three aspects: "reason A=B", \
"reason A>B", and "reason B>A", and finally make your choice for \
the final assessment.

Please provide your evaluation results in the following json \
format by filling in the placeholders in []:
```
{
    "analysis of A": "[analysis of Response A]",
    "analysis of B": "[analysis of Response B]",
    "reason of A=B": "[where Response A and B perform equally well]",
    "reason of A>B": "[where Response A is better than Response B]",
    "reason of B>A": "[where Response B is better than Response A]",
    "choice": "[A++ or A+ or A=B or B+ or B++]",
}
```
