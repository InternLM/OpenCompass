## Introduction
The following introduction comes from the abstract in [Language models are multilingual chain-of-thought reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03057)

```
We introduce the Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM) benchmark, by manually translating 250 grade-school math problems from the GSM8K dataset into ten typologically diverse languages.
