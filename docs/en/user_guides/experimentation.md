# Task Execution and Monitoring

## Initiation of Assessment Task

The program entry for the assessment task is `run.py`, its usage is as follows:

```shell
run.py [-p PARTITION] [-q QUOTATYPE] [--debug] [-m MODE] [-r [REUSE]] [-w WORKDIR] [-l LARK] config
```

The parameter explanation is as follows:

- -p Specify the slurm partition;
- -q Specify the slurm quotatype (default is auto), with optional values being reserved, auto, spot;
- --debug When enabled, inference and evaluation tasks will run in single-process mode, and output will be echoed in real-time for debugging;
- -m Run mode, default is all. It can be specified as infer to only run inference and obtain output results; if there are already model outputs in {WORKDIR}, it can be specified as eval to only run evaluation and obtain evaluation results; if there are individual evaluation results in results, it can be specified as viz to only run visualization; if specified as all, both inference and evaluation tasks run at the same time.
- -r Reuse existing inference results. If followed by a timestamp, the result under that timestamp in the workspace path will be reused; otherwise, the latest result in the specified workspace path will be reused.
- -w Specify the working path, default is ./outputs/default
- -l Enable status reporting via Lark bot.

Using run mode `-m all` as an example, the overall execution flow is as follows:

1. Read the configuration file, parse out the model, dataset, evaluator, and other configuration information
2. The evaluation task mainly includes three stages: inference infer, evaluation eval, and visualization viz. After task division by Partitioner, they are handed over to Runner for parallel execution. Individual inference and evaluation tasks are abstracted into OpenICLInferTask and OpenICLEvalTask respectively.
3. After each stage ends, the visualization stage will read the evaluation results in results to generate a visualization report.

## Task Monitoring: Lark Bot

Users can enable real-time monitoring of task status by setting up a Lark bot. Please refer to [this document](https://open.feishu.cn/document/ukTMukTMukTM/ucTM5YjL3ETO24yNxkjN?lang=zh-CN#7a28964d) for setting up the Lark bot.

Configuration method:

1. Open the `configs/lark.py` file, and add the following line:

```python
lark_bot_url = 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL'
```

Typically, the Webhook URL is formatted like this: https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx .

2. Inherit this file in the complete evaluation configuration:

```python
  from mmengine.config import read_base

  with read_base():
      from .lark import lark_bot_url

```

3. To avoid frequent messages from the bot becoming a nuisance, status updates are not automatically reported by default. You can start status reporting using `-l` or `--lark` when needed:

```bash
python run.py configs/eval_demo.py -p {PARTITION} -l
```

## Introduction of Summerizer

It is mainly used to visualize evaluation results.

## Run Results

All run results will be placed in `outputs/default/` directory by default, the directory structure is shown below:

```
outputs/default/
├── 20200220_120000
├── ...
├── 20230220_183030
│   ├── configs
│   ├── logs
│   │   ├── eval
│   │   └── infer
│   ├── predictions
│   │   └── MODEL1
│   └── results
│       └── MODEL1
```

Each timestamp contains the following content:

- configs folder, which stores the configuration files corresponding to each run with this timestamp as the output directory;
- logs folder, which stores the output log files of the inference and evaluation phases, each folder will store logs in subfolders by model;
- predictions folder, which stores the inferred json results, with a model subfolder;
- results folder, which stores the evaluated json results, with a model subfolder.

Also, all `-r` without specifying a corresponding timestamp will select the newest folder by sorting as the output directory.
