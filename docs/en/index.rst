Hands-on Roadmap of OpenCompass
-------------------------------

To help users quickly utilize OpenCompass, we recommend following the hands-on
roadmap we have created for the library:

   - For users who want to use OpenCompass, we recommend reading the GetStarted_ section first to set up the environment.

   - For some basic usage, we suggest users read the UserGuides_.

   - If you want to adjust the prompts, you can browse the Prompt_.

   - If you want to customize the algorithm, we have provided the AdvancedGuides_.

   - We also offer the Tools_.

We always welcome *PRs* and *Issues* for the betterment of MMPretrain.
